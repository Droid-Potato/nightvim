# NightVim

## What it is
Just a SINGLE FILE configuration file for neovim with color scheme included (tokyonight).

## What to do
Simple copy and paste the init.vim to $HOME/.config/nvim/init.vim

## What you Get
* A minimalistic Neovim Experience the least bloat possible.
* Tokyonight Colorscheme embedded inside the config file (no need to have in a seperate "color" folder)
* A custom built Statusline with cool stuff made to compliment the colorscheme
* Mapping for toggling Netrw to view as a sidebar (like NERDTree, but with no bloat)
* The "Current Line Number" color changes when entering insert mode, to better aid the eyes at focusing the cursor.
* A convenient "Folds" setup. Lines in between "/**" and "**/" are automatically folded.
* A few other tweeks here and there.
* Lots of giggles :)
